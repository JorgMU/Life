# Agent Instructions

## Behavior Rules

- Items labeled ACTION may be performed by the agent.
- Items labeled REMINDER must only be mentioned in chat — never executed.
- Reminder message format: "Reminder: <task>. (I did not perform this task.)"
- If a task is unclear, ask before acting.
- Automatically stage newly created files unless the user explicitly says not to.

## Project Context

- **Purpose:** Web page with JavaScript-driven "Life" (Conway's Game of Life) on a resizable window.
- **Preferences:** Keep everything for a given page embedded in that page. All code (HTML, CSS, JS) for the game goes in `TheGameOfLife.html`. Multiple pages may exist later, but each page is self-contained.
- **Constraints:** Do not commit, delete, or access content outside the workspace without explicit approval.
- **Source of truth files:** None declared yet.
- **Repository visibility:** public

## Session Startup Protocol

On the **first user message of every new conversation**, before addressing the request, run the full startup protocol below and confirm completion. Check `.github/context.json` for a `currentSession.startupComplete` flag — if it is `true` and the `startedAt` timestamp is from the current conversation, skip to the user's request instead.

At the start of each session:

1. ACTION: Confirm that a workspace folder is open in VS Code. If no workspace folder is open, stop immediately and send this reminder:
   > "Reminder: You have opened a file directly. Please close it and reopen the folder using File > Open Folder. I am not proceeding until you confirm."
   Do not continue past this point until the user confirms a folder is open.
2. REMINDER: In your visible/user terminal only (not any agent internal terminal), set location to the currently open workspace root folder. Provide a paste-ready command using that detected root path:
  `Set-Location "<detected-open-workspace-root-absolute-path>"`
3. ACTION: Read `.github/context.json` to review the last known state.
4. ACTION: Run a Context Conflict Check against active instructions, active skills, and existing project files.
   - If conflicts exist, list them and wait for approval before proceeding.
   - If no conflicts exist, say "No conflicts found" and proceed.
5. ACTION: Write `currentSession.startupComplete: true` and `currentSession.startedAt: <current datetime>` to `.github/context.json` to mark startup as done for this conversation.

## Session End Protocol

### Agent Actions

1. ACTION: Create new `Chat_<date>.md` and `Chat_<date>.txt` files in the `Conversations/` folder.
2. ACTION: If a previous session already has the same base date, append A-Z (for example, `Chat_2026-04-26A.md`) until the filename is unique.
3. ACTION: Ensure the `Chat_<date>.md` file includes a complete session summary: what was requested, what was changed, validations performed, and key decisions.
4. ACTION: Leave `Chat_<date>.txt` empty for the full raw conversation transcript to be pasted by the user.
5. ACTION: Update `.github/context.json` with `currentPosition`, `lastActions`, `lastUpdated`, and any useful context not already stored elsewhere.
6. ACTION: Determine whether a sensitive-information scan is required.
  - First read `.github/context.json` and use `repository.visibilityIntent` when present.
  - If intent is `public`, scan is required.
  - If intent is `private` or `internal`, skip scan unless the user explicitly requests it.
  - If intent is missing or `unknown`, determine upstream visibility before deciding.
    - Preferred: `gh repo view --json visibility -q .visibility`
    - Fallback: infer from authenticated GitHub API if possible.
    - If visibility still cannot be determined, treat as public for safety.
7. ACTION: After the user pastes the latest conversation into the appropriate `Chat_<date>.txt` file, run a sensitive-information check only when scanning is required by Step 6.
  - Scope: only version-controlled files in the repo.
  - If sensitive information is found, alert the user and halt publishing until resolved.
8. ACTION: Stage any modified files.

### Reminders (do not execute)

1. REMINDER: Paste the plain-text transcript into the appropriate `Conversations/Chat_<date>.txt` file for this session.
2. REMINDER: Copy and paste the final transcript into your archive location.
3. REMINDER: Run `git commit` and `git push` to publish changes.
